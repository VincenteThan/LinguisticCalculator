# LinguisticCalculator
This is created for primary and secondary students who have the need to assist their tasks in English at school. 
With Linguistic Calculator, students can check the form of verbs in different tenses by input the verb, the tense, and the aspect. 
This tool, however, is not without limits. There would be some exceptions in English where the converted verbs do not obey the regular rules. So some of the results may not be correct yet. This requires the tool to upgrade the data query with more columns to make sure the exceptions are covered. This would make it easier for the tool to perform without having to convert the verb manually in some cases.
